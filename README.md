## Exercises  

### **1. Power Operations (`Targil 1`)**  
- Implements power calculations using tuples as immutable structures.  
- Supports operations like multiplication, division, and simplification of powers.  
- Demonstrates higher-order functions and functional programming concepts.  

### **2. Binary Tree (`Targil 2`)**  
- Implements a binary tree with functional access methods.  
- Supports searching, counting occurrences, and checking if the tree is balanced.  
- Demonstrates recursion and hierarchical data processing.  

### **3. Pricing System (`Targil 3`)**  
- Implements a pricing system with discounts based on store and product type.  
- Uses dictionary-based data handling and functional programming techniques.  

### **4. Accumulate Prices (`Targil 4`)**  
- Uses the `reduce()` function to calculate total prices across different stores.  
- Demonstrates lambda functions and higher-order functions in Python.  

### **5. Parking Management (`Targil 5`)**  
- Implements a parking lot system with priority levels (Regular, Priority, VIP).  
- Supports real-time updates and vehicle tracking.  
- Demonstrates dictionary-based state management and procedural logic.
